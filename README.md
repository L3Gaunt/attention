Attention is the key mechanism of the transformer architecture that
powers GPT and other LLMs. This project exposes the attention
weights of an LLM run, aggregated into a single matrix by averaging across layers and attention heads.

Here's an example of what the matrix output of this project will look like:

Why model attention as a matrix? Given attention matrix `m` you can model
a range of text as focus vector `f` and then multiply
`torch.matmul(f, m)` to get the attention vector for that range.

When you run the flask app, you can use an interactive demo in which attention
weights for selected text are visualized:

## How to Run

```sh
$ poetry install
$ poetry run flask --app attention run
```

Once it's running, you can access the demo at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/index.html`.
